            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
                Marvel Comics. The character was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry
                Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in
                Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968).
                Also in 1963, the character founded the Avengers alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.
                A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony
                Edward "Tony" Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force
                him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his
                life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological
                devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to
                protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually publicly
                reveals himself to be Iron Man.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">THOR</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In Germanic mythology, Thor (/θɔːr/; from Old Norse: Þórr) is a
                hammer-wielding god associated with lightning, thunder, storms, sacred groves and trees, strength, the
                protection of mankind and also hallowing and fertility. Besides Old Norse Þórr, the deity occurs in Old
                English as Þunor, in Old Frisian as Thuner, in Old Saxon as Thunar, and in Old High German as Donar, all
                ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Þun(a)raz, meaning 'Thunder'.
                Thor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the recorded history of the Germanic peoples, from the
                Roman occupation of regions of Germania, to the Germanic expansions of the Migration Period, to his high
                popularity during the Viking Age, when, in the face of the process of the Christianization of
                Scandinavia, emblems of his hammer, Mjölnir, were worn and Norse pagan personal names containing the
                name of the god bear witness to his popularity.

                The Hulk is a fictional character and superhero appearing in publications by the American publisher
                Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the
                debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character is both the
                Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and
                his alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved
                physicist. The two exist as independent dissociative personalities, and resent each other.
                Lee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
                Hyde.Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the
                most usual color is green.
